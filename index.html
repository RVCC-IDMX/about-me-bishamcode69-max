                    <p>
                        Namaste! I am Bisham Khanal, a technology enthusiast originally from the beautiful landscapes of Nepal, now studying in New Brunswick, NJ. My journey into the world of computers started not with code, but with hardware. I spent years fascinated by what goes on inside a PC case, building custom rigs, troubleshooting component failures, and obsessing over the latest GPU benchmarks. That curiosity naturally evolved into software development, where I found a new passion for building things that live on the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am diving deep into Front-End Development. While this site is built with foundational HTML and CSS, I have a growing interest in modern frameworks like React and Vite. I love the logic of coding—it feels like solving a complex puzzle where the reward is a functional, beautiful interface. When I am not debugging code or tweaking CSS layouts, I am usually keeping up with the latest tech news or experimenting with new Linux distros.

                    <h2>Bringing the Web to Life: An Intro to CSS Animation</h2>
                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>
                            In the early days of the web, pages were static. Content sat still, waiting for a user to scroll. Today, however, modern web development relies heavily on motion to guide user attention, provide feedback, and create immersive experiences. One of the most powerful tools for achieving this is <strong>CSS Animation</strong>. Unlike JavaScript, which can be heavy and complex, CSS animations allow developers to animate transitions and movements using simple, declarative code that runs smoothly in the browser.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What is a Keyframe?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The heart of any CSS animation is the <code>@keyframes</code> rule. Think of it like a movie storyboard. You define what the element looks like at the start (0%) and what it looks like at the end (100%). You can even add steps in between. For example, you might tell a button to start blue, turn red halfway through, and turn blue again at the end. The browser does the heavy lifting of calculating the "frames" in between these points to create smooth motion.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Visual Example: The Bouncing Ball</h3>
                        <p>
                            To demonstrate how properties like <code>transform</code> and <code>animation-timing-function</code> work together, I have created a visual example below. This "Bouncing Ball" uses a custom keyframe animation to simulate gravity.
                        </p>

                        <div class="animation-demo-container">
                            <div class="bouncing-ball"></div>
                            <p class="caption">Figure 1: A CSS infinite loop using ease-in and ease-out.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            In the example above, the ball doesn't just move up and down at a constant speed; that would look robotic. Instead, we use an <code>ease-in</code> timing function when it falls (to simulate speeding up) and an <code>ease-out</code> function when it rises (to simulate slowing down against gravity). This attention to physics makes the web feel more organic.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Why Use CSS Over JavaScript?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Performance is the main reason. CSS animations are often "hardware accelerated," meaning the browser can offload the work to the computer's Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This results in buttery smooth 60-frames-per-second animations, even on lower-end mobile devices. Additionally, CSS is fault-tolerant; if a browser doesn't understand the animation code, it simply ignores it and shows the static element, ensuring the content is still accessible.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mastering CSS animation opens up a world of creativity. Whether it is a subtle hover effect on a navigation link or a complex loading screen, motion brings personality to a project. As I continue my journey in "Web Dev I", I plan to experiment further with combining these animations with user interactions to create truly dynamic interfaces.
