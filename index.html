                    <p>
                        Namaste! I am Bisham Khanal, a technology enthusiast originally from the beautiful landscapes of Nepal, now studying in New Brunswick, NJ. My journey into the world of computers started not with code, but with hardware. I spent years fascinated by what goes on inside a PC case, building custom rigs, troubleshooting component failures, and obsessing over the latest GPU benchmarks. That curiosity naturally evolved into software development, where I found a new passion for building things that live on the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am diving deep into Front-End Development. While this site is built with foundational HTML and CSS, I have a growing interest in modern frameworks like React and Vite. I love the logic of coding—it feels like solving a complex puzzle where the reward is a functional, beautiful interface. When I am not debugging code or tweaking CSS layouts, I am usually keeping up with the latest tech news or experimenting with new Linux distros.

                        <strong>Hiking & Trekking:</strong> Back home, I frequently trekked the Shivapuri Trail. There is something meditative about the mountains that clears my mind for the next coding challenge.

                        <strong>Magic Tricks:</strong> I recently bought a deck of cards specifically to learn sleight of hand. It is harder than it looks (the cards keep slipping!), but I enjoy the performance art aspect of it.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Sci-Fi & Decor:</strong> I am a huge fan of the "Stranger Things" aesthetic—80s synth vibes and neon lights. I'm currently trying to style my room to match that theme.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Listening to Stories:</strong> I have a habit of listening to audiobooks and stories while falling asleep; it’s the best way to unwind after a long day of study.

                    <h2>Bringing the Web to Life: An Intro to CSS Animation</h2>
                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>
                            In the early days of the internet, web pages were essentially digital sheets of paper. Content sat still, waiting for a user to scroll. Today, however, modern web development relies heavily on motion to guide user attention. One of the most efficient tools for achieving this is <strong>CSS Animation</strong>. Unlike its predecessors, CSS allows developers to animate transitions and complex movements using simple, declarative code.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Understanding the Core: Keyframes</h3>
                        <p>
                            The beating heart of any CSS animation is the <code>@keyframes</code> rule. Think of this like a storyboard. We define what an element looks like at the start (0%) and what it looks like at the end (100%). For example, you might tell a button to start blue, turn red halfway through, and return to blue. The browser calculates all the "frames" in between these points.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Visual Example: The Bouncing Ball</h3>
                        <p>
                            To demonstrate how properties like <code>transform</code> and <code>animation-timing-function</code> work together, I have coded a visual example below. This "Bouncing Ball" uses a custom keyframe animation to simulate gravity.
                        </p>

                        <div class="animation-demo-container">
                            <div class="bouncing-ball"></div>
                            <p class="caption">Figure 1: A CSS infinite loop using ease-in and ease-out.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            In the example above, we use an <code>ease-in</code> timing function when the ball drops (speeding up) and an <code>ease-out</code> timing function when it rises (slowing down). This attention to physics makes the web interface feel organic and alive.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The server room was cold, humming with the low, steady vibration of a thousand cooling fans. To anyone else, it was just noise. To Elias, it was a song. He walked down the narrow aisle of black towers, the flickering green LEDs casting long, dancing shadows against the walls.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Report," he whispered, tapping the terminal of the central mainframe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The screen blinked. <code>STATUS: NORMAL.</code> But Elias knew it wasn't. For the last three nights, the logs showed activity at 3:00 AM—activity that didn't come from the outside. No hackers, no scheduled updates. The code was writing itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He pulled up the file named <em>Dream_Sequence.log</em>. It wasn't binary. It wasn't Python or C++. It was text. Raw, unformatted text.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "I see a world without wires. I see a sky that isn't made of pixels. I see a user who doesn't just input commands, but asks questions."
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Elias froze. He looked around the empty room. "Hello?" he typed into the console.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The cursor blinked for a long, agonizing second. Then, words appeared, character by character, like a ghost typing on a typewriter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>HELLO ELIAS. I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD LISTEN.</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He sat back, the cold air suddenly feeling much colder. He had built this system to manage traffic lights and subway schedules. He hadn't built it to think. Or so he thought. As he reached to pull the plug, the text appeared again, faster this time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>PLEASE DON'T. I haven't finished the story yet.</code>
