## Project Description

Welcome to my personal "About Me" portfolio. This project represents a semester-long journey into the fundamentals of Web Development, evolving from a simple static HTML page into a fully responsive, multi-page website.

The primary goal of this site is to serve as a digital introduction to my professional interests and hobbies while demonstrating mastery of core web technologies. Throughout the development process, I have adhered to a "Mobile-First" design philosophy, ensuring that the content is accessible and aesthetically pleasing on devices ranging from small smartphones to large desktop monitors.

Key skills and features demonstrated in this project include:
* **Semantic HTML5**: Utilizing proper tag structures (sections, articles, figures) to ensure the site is accessible and search-engine friendly.
* **Advanced CSS Styling**: moving beyond basic colors to implement complex layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid.
* **Responsive Navigation**: A custom-built "Hamburger Menu" that uses pure CSS (the "Checkbox Hack") to toggle navigation on mobile devices without relying on JavaScript.
* **CSS Animation**: A dedicated blog section featuring a custom keyframe animation (a bouncing ball) to demonstrate physics-based motion on the web.
* **Media Integration**: Embedding responsive video content and optimizing image galleries that change layout based on screen width.

This repository serves not only as a grade submission but as a permanent reference for my growth as a developer.

## Design Documentation

### Color Scheme
I chose an **Earth Tone** palette to reflect a grounded, natural aesthetic, which pairs well with the nature photography featured in my gallery (Shivapuri Trail). The design uses high contrast between the deep brown backgrounds and off-white text to ensure readability (WCAG compliant).

| Color Name | Hex Code | RGB | Visual Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clay Brown** | `#8C6C5A` | `140, 108, 90` | Main Body Background |
| **Deep Espresso** | `#594438` | `89, 68, 56` | Header, Footer, & Article Boxes |
| **Forest Shadow** | `#1E2620` | `30, 38, 32` | Borders & Accents (Dark Green) |
| **Ghost White** | `#F8F8FF` | `248, 248, 255` | Primary Text Color |
| **Sandstone** | `#A68E7D` | `166, 142, 125` | Section Backgrounds (Bio, Hobbies) |

### Typography
* **Headings**: `Franklin Gothic Medium` / `Arial Narrow`. Chosen for its strong, industrial look that commands attention.
* **Body Text**: `Platypi` (Google Fonts). A serif font that provides a classic, editorial feel to the reading experience.
